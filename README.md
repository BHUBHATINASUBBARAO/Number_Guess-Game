The Number Guessing Game is a beginner-friendly web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is simple: the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the correct number. After each guess, the game provides feedbackâ€”indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
This project is designed to help new developers understand core JavaScript concepts such as:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Conditional logic
- Random number generation
- Basic input validation
The game also includes a guess counter that tracks how many attempts the player has made, and a restart button to reset the game and play again. The user interface is styled with CSS to provide a clean and responsive layout.
This project is ideal for practicing interactive web development and can be extended with additional features like difficulty levels, sound effects, or animation.
